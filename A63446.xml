            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True and Perfect Relation of the New Invented Way OF Perſecuting the Proteſtants in FRANCE.</head>
            <head type="sub">TOGETHER With the Manner, Time and Place, when and where it firſt begun to Act: As alſo an Exact Account after what manner it is purſued contrary to the Priviledges granted to them by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. and this King now Reigning; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BY the Edict of <hi>Nantz,</hi> on the 6th general Article, and the firſt particular Act, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, without Lett or Moleſtation, is there moſt expreſly promiſed to all Proteſtants that were then, or ſhould be hereafter; and by the 7 h general Act is granted full Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion, and to ſeveral Noblemen Liberty to Preach in their houſes, and to have Churches in their Burroughs. By the 37th Article it is ſaid, That all the Proteſtants ſhall enjoy all Offices and Honours in all places of the King's Territories; and that they ſhall be no more charged nor oppreſſed with Impoſitions ordinary or extraordinary, than the Catholicks; and in order thereunto it is ſaid in the 30,31, and 57 Acts, that the Proteſtants ſhall aſſiſt as Judges in the Parliaments, &amp; Chambers as Demy-parties; that is to ſay, half Papiſt, and half Proteſtants to Judge, without Appeal, of all Differences that they might have with their fellow-ſubjects. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th confirmed it by his Declaration of the 22th of <hi>May</hi> 1610. This King hath alſo aſſured all Europe, by ſeveral Authentick Declarations, that he would maintain the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> according to the deſire of his Grandfather, who had made it an irrevocable Law, in regard of the faithful Service they did tender to the Crown, having teſtified an inviolable Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him in all his troubles, it is notorious to all the world, that they have freely ſpent their Lives and Fortunes to defend him, and have continued the ſame for this King againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and all his Enemies. Notwithſtanding all that, the ſaid King hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away all the Civil Offices from the Proteſtants, by a Declaration of the 6th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1679. and of the 23d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1680. The 20th of <hi>November</hi> 1679. it is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Declaration, That there ſhall be no Synod without the King's leave, and without a Papiſt Commiſſary. <hi>March</hi> 1679. The 13th day a Declaration forbidding them that are turned Papiſts ever to turn Proteſtants again, upon Confiſcation of their Eſtates, and other Penalties. 1680. <hi>June</hi> 25. Another Declaration, forbidding Papiſts to turn Proteſtants 1680. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 27th. Another Declaration forbidding Proteſtants to have any Concern in His Majeſties Farms, or any other Offices. 1680. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 18. The King hath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that Accounts ſhould be given of the Money that hath been gathered in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, ſince the year 1670. they not knowing his deſign. At the ſame time another Declaration which ſaith, <hi>That any Proteſtant that will turn Papiſt, ſhall not be compelled to pay any Debts during three years;</hi> which is for ever; <hi>nor ſhall they have any increaſe in their Taxes.</hi> 1680. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 2. Another Declaration which orders the Juſtices to viſit the Sick; and the ſaid Juſtices turn all the people out of their houſes, and ſay what they pleaſe to the Sick, and ſo report that he will die a Catholick; and if he dieth, they take their Children, and their Eſtates; ſo bring them up as they pleaſe. 1681; <hi>April</hi> 11. A Gratification is publiſhed for them that will turn Papiſts, ſaying, <hi>They ſhall have no Charge of Souldiers during two years, nor pay any Contribution.</hi> 1681. <hi>May</hi> 3. It is forbidden by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Declaration, to all Proteſt. Trades-men, to take any Apprentice Proteſtant nor Papiſt. 1681. <hi>July</hi> 8. A Declaration that giveth leave to all Children ſeven years old, to turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt their Parents will. 1681. <hi>July</hi> 4. An Order to proceed againſt the Miniſters, which did not give a right Explication to the King's Declaration of the 19th of <hi>May</hi> laſt. Several Colledges have been aboliſhed; and it is not ſuffered to have any Schoolmaſters, but where there is Churches, and but one in every place. 1681. <hi>July</hi> 9. The King did order there ſhould be no more Academy at <hi>Sedan.</hi> 1680. <hi>Feb.</hi> 20. The Proteſtant Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives are forbidden to make uſe any more of their Employments. 1681. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4. A Declaration by which it is ordered, That whereas ſeveral Churches have been demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſeveral Miniſters of thoſe places have gone to other Churches to Preach, His Majeſty, to leſſen the number, hath declared, That Synods ſhould not ſend any ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to Preach; and that there ſhould be no more Miniſters in the Churches that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, than there was before the Laſt Synod.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51693:2"/>
            <p>AT <hi>Poictiers,</hi> the Chief City of <hi>Poicton,</hi> ſeveral Prieſts and other Perſons were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go to ſeveral Proteſtants houſes to offer them Corn and Money if they were willing to go to Maſs: ſome did accept of it, others did not; according to their bargain they were paid, and ſo turned Papiſts: this continued about 3 weeks; then they ſet out Proclamations that ſuch People that would go to Maſs, might come to ſuch places, there they ſhould be very well entertained with money. Several People did ſcorn their proffers, others did lay hold of them; this laſted 3 weeks more, and the People that imployed themſelves about ſuch work, had a Crown for their pains, of as many Perſons as they got.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers</hi> took a Journey through all his Dioceſs, and in every place he went, cauſed all the people that were Proteſtants to come to him, telling them that the Kings intent was to have all his Subjects Papiſts, their beſt was to do it in time, and that he had order to give them money. I ſhall here mark the anſwer of a Countrey ſellow, called <hi>Peter Fouet</hi> of <hi>Kouvres,</hi> who ſaid, truly my Lord, when I go to a market to Exchange a Horſe, if I give Boot, it is becauſe I would have a beter than mine; therefore I think my Religion better than yours, becauſe you give money to Boot. However, many did take money and left their Religion; the ſaid Biſhop uſing many words and promiſes to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the money he gave. About the Latter end of <hi>May</hi> the Intendant of that Province took a Journey in moſt places where there were Proteſtants. He did ſend for the people, as the Biſhop had done before, but was very harſh to them, ſaying, they muſt go to Maſs, if they did not, their houſes ſhould be well furniſh'd with Souldiers: ſome did ſcorn his proffers and threats, others did turn. At the beginning of <hi>June</hi> there went a Company of Troupers to a place called <hi>Melle;</hi> they all Lodged at the Proteſtants houſes, and utterly ruined them, cauſing the Inhabitants to find abundance of proviſions more than they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, making great ſpoil with Dogs and Horſes and Money every morning, ſome 20, 30, 40, Livres of their Landlord; they had Feather-beds and clean Linnen carried into ſtables to lay their Horſes upon. At the ſame time a Company of Troupers went to a great Burrough called <hi>Exondun,</hi> acting the ſame thing: ſome changed, others abſented themſelves. At the ſame time they went to a place called <hi>Eſchiré,</hi> the Lord of that place is a Proteſtant, <hi>Monſieur De La Tailléé:</hi> They did proceed as in the places aforeſaid; the people did ſubmit as long as they had moneys in hopes it would not laſt long. But being no more able to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them at ſuch Rates, ſome did forſake their houſes, others did turn; then they took to Ride up and down in every Village, thereabouts, in ſeveral Proteſtant houſes acting the ſame. The Lord of <hi>Baiſragen</hi> gave a viſit to the Intendant, making complaints of the Souldiers misbehaviours; his Anſwer was to him, That his Burrough ſhould have a ſhare; the ſaid Lord told him, none ſhould Lodge there without the King's ſpecial order; the Intendant obtained the ſame, and withall, to take him Priſoner, which was Executed and he was carried to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in <hi>Charteau Trumpette,</hi> where he is, ſtill and the Souldiers did utterly ruine the Place; then they went to <hi>Cherneux,</hi> and St. <hi>Gallais,</hi> the Lords of them places are Papiſts, and there acted as before in Proteſtant houſes only. They went alſo to St. <hi>Maxire</hi> to <hi>Villiers,</hi> to <hi>Murſay,</hi> and to a place called <hi>Bennet,</hi> ſix miles diſtant from <hi>Niort,</hi> drawing towards Low <hi>Poicton;</hi> there the People after great ſufferings, fled into the Fields, and hid themſelves night and day; the Souldiers having notice of it by ſome Papiſt, hunted them poor People with Dogs, miſuſed them, and brought them to their houſes again; ſome did turn, others reſiſted. In <hi>July</hi> they went to St. <hi>Elemoy</hi> to <hi>Panpron,</hi> to <hi>Sanſay,</hi> to <hi>Bagneau,</hi> and <hi>Chenay,</hi> there acting the ſame things. They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at a conſiderable Town called <hi>Luſignan,</hi> there dealing as wickedly as in other places; then they came round about St. <hi>Maixant,</hi> in all the Burroughs joyning the Gates, acting the ſame Cruelties, but went not into the Town. They went alſo at <hi>Aigonnay</hi> and <hi>Chef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutowne,</hi> and other places which I name not here. Several Gentlemen were appointed to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> to acquaint the King of thoſe wicked proceedings, (the Marquis of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> and his Son, who have been great ſufferers for ſpeaking the truth to the King: the reſt of the Deputies were ſent to the Marquis of <hi>Rivigny,</hi> not being admitted to ſpeak to the King.) The Governour of <hi>Poicton</hi> called the <hi>Duke La Vien Villes,</hi> was ordered to go in his Government, and there to hear the Complaints of all them that were moleſted; upon that the ſaid Proteſtants did rejoyce at the Governours Arrival. Several Complaints made to him, his Anſwer was, he could not believe there was ſo much miſchief done, and that in few daies he would ſee Mon. <hi>Marilac</hi> Intendant; when they had ſpoken together, the Intendant did ſend eight Souldiers where there was but four before, and ſo jeſted, and asked if they had not good Juſtice of the Governour.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lucon</hi> gave the Governour a Viſit; after that the Governour did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51693:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſend his Guards, ſeven, or eight at a time in a houſe, dealing as wickedly with the People in the Low <hi>Poicton</hi> as the Dragoons had done in other places; this laſted about a month, then the Biſhop of <hi>Lucon</hi> had a Jubile, he imployed himſelf to draw the People to him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Souldiers did return again to <hi>Bennet,</hi> they finding neither Mony nor Victuals in the Houſes of the People that was returned; they thinking the buſineſs over (the Souldiers miſuſed them, and cauſed many to turn;) the Souldier finding nothing to feed themſelves at the Houſes of them that perſiſted did repair to the Chief Commanders to acquaint them of the ſame, deſiring other Quarters; their anſwer was, That as long as there was any Moveables in their Houſes, they ſhould have no other quarters, but ſhould ſell it all fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their ſubſiſtence. At a place called <hi>Champdenie,</hi> a Market-town, many Families did forſake their houſes, and carried away the beſt goods they had, having notice the Souldiers were to come there; whereupon the Intendant did proclaim, That all the Inhabitants of that Province, that had abſented themſelves for fear of lodging Souldiers, ſhould forthwith return to their houſes upon the Penalty of five hundred Livres; but very few did obey.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Souldiers had Liberty to go where they pleaſed, except in the Cities, and had no other Orders but a Bill from the Prieſts of every Pariſh; in which was written, ſuch a man is an Huguenot, and ſo there lodged at diſcretion, that did occaſion many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring men to fly, and ſeveral did forſake their Corn in the Fields, which never was cut down, but deſtroyed. They did take ſome Peazants, and burnt their wooden Shooes, their feet being therein. <hi>James Panon</hi> did ſuffer this, and did not change his Religion. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that are committed for the Taxes, called <hi>Elus,</hi> went about in every Pariſh to take a Lift of what Proteſtants remained; alſo an account of what means they had, to the end and purpoſe, as I ſhall tell hereafter in the New Way of Perſecuting.</p>
            <p>In <hi>September</hi> the Souldiers went to <hi>Partenay,</hi> and the neighbouring Places; and becauſe the People began to run away at their coming, they went no more in the day, but in the night, and ſo did Catch the People in their houſes, and keep them in torments until they Changed, or made their Eſcape. In the ſame month went a Company to a place called <hi>La Motte;</hi> the Lord of it is called <hi>Count Parabelle,</hi> a Papiſt; they ſurprized the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in their houſes; that place was thought full of Religious people, and that would ſooner have loſt their Eſtates, than their Religion, but it proved otherwiſe; they ſtood but three daies, except twenty that abſented themſelves: They did alſo great Cruelties at <hi>Coulonge;</hi> then the Souldiers took their March, where they had been before to ſee if any were returned, and ſo continued their wickedneſs, which occaſioned many to turn and them that would not, did forſake the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts all the Kingdom over, did forbid the People to buy any Goods of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; ſo that if any was ſold, it was by ſtealth; laying upon the Buyers a great Charge, ſaying, Theſe People have no Religion, their Means are their Gods; to ſave them they will turn to us; and the want of Money will keep them here; but if they have Money, they will return into the Hereticks Country; and you that buy ſuch Goods muſt needs be damned, and ſuffer double pains, becauſe you are a help or inſtrument to convey thoſe People from the true Faith; upon that all manner of Goods were cheap; but ſeveral of them did buy ſecretly ſuch Goods as they did forbid others to buy. The Magiſtrates of every place did alſo forbid to buy any thing of the Proteſtants upon great penalties. From <hi>Niort</hi> a great Town in the ſaid Province, ſeveral Gentlemen, Women, and Children ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped themſelves upon the River of <hi>Maran;</hi> the Magiſtrates of that place having notice of the ſame, Commanded ſome Souldiers to follow them, and they were taken at a place called <hi>LaRouſeille,</hi> &amp; plundered; they did undreſs the Women &amp; Children, &amp; found Gold hid in their young Babes clouts, and elſewhere, amounting to conſiderable Sums, and carried them back at <hi>Niort,</hi> the Men put in Priſon, the Women and Children at the Hoſpital: Complaint being made to the Intendant, he ordered, that if they would not turn, they ſhould remain there until they had ſpent their mony at the rate of ſix pence <hi>per</hi> day for every Perſon, at ſeveral places the Souldiers made people ſit up night and day, without ſleeping, taking by turn, drinking, and eating, making the People of the Houſe continually to wait upon them, and ſo cauſed the death of many. They have carried old People in ſheets to Church, &amp; there made them ſay that they were Roman Catholicks, &amp; if they recanted, to be hanged, as Apoſtates. They have beaten many, &amp; drawn about the ſtreets by the hair:If a Papiſt oweth to a Proteſtant Monies upon a petition, ſuppoſing the Proteſtant intends to withdraw himſelf, the Papiſt ſhall obtain daley at his pleaſure, A very great volume might be made of all their Cruelties; the People being thus perplexed, begun in <hi>July</hi> to draw towards <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to ſeek a retreit into the Proteſtant Princes Countries, in <hi>England</hi> chiefly, under the Right Defender of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51693:3"/>the Faith. The People were ſuffered at firſt to ſhip themſelves with what Goods they had to carry; it laſted ſo until <hi>September,</hi> then they did hinder them to carry any thing, the Cuſtomers were forbidden to clear any manner of Houſhold-ſtuff; but the People were ſuffered to go in quiet, provided they carried nothing, not ſo much as a Bed or Covering; that laſted until the middle of <hi>Octob.</hi> Then one Mr. <hi>Thomas Tailor</hi> of <hi>Southampton</hi> was ſtopt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Digue</hi> at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> with 200 Paſſengers, pretending to confiſcate his Ship, by reaſon of his Shipping of them; the Ship was brought in the Harbour, and a Meſſenger ſent to the Intendant of <hi>Rochefort,</hi> which did nothing in it, but ſaid he would write to Court; in the mean time a Merchant of <hi>Rochelle</hi> arreſted the Goods that were aboard, belonging to one Mr. <hi>Meſuire Frighter,</hi> to which he was indebted, but the ſaid <hi>Tailor</hi> hath ſince been abſolutely cleared of his pretended Crime.</p>

               <p>THE Officers for the Taxes called <hi>Elus,</hi> having informed the Intendant of every man's faculty, he at his diſcretion layeth Taxes upon the Proteſtants; ſeveral that have not three hundred Livres <hi>per annum,</hi> are Taxed at a thouſand Livres; and the whole Taxes of a Town are joyntly and ſeverally upon the Inhabitants, ſo that they may take one man for the whole payment, and let him recover it when he can, and that in regard of Proteſtants only.

               <p>They take review of all the proceſs that hath been made within this 25 years, and if they find any conſiderable, wherein a Proteſtant hath had the beſt of it, they recal it, and ſay, there was a miſtake, and that it muſt be Examined anew by the Intendant, and ſo caſt the poor Proteſtant, unleſs he will turn Papiſt.

The ſecond of <hi>December</hi> there was a <hi>Scotch</hi> ſhip that took in about 100 paſſengers; at the laſt Boats coming off from a place called <hi>Point of Miniſme</hi> near the <hi>Digue</hi> at <hi>Rochel,</hi> there came ſeveral arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men who Commanded the boat to return one the ſhore, and bring the people again, upon denial they did diſcharge their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
